        <h1>My Favorite Excerpt</h1>
        <p1>"THE POWER OF YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND"</p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p4>
        An age-old book that re-defined the way self-help books are written and understood.
        Joseph Murphy was a doctor of psychology who wrote extensively about the power of the subconscious mind.
        <br>

        In this book, Murphy contemplates a theory that the subconscious mind has a powerful effect on everything we do and experience. He says that, if we as an individual can believe in something and visualize it clearly, we can remove all the mental blocks to achieve the desired results.
        <br>

        He concludes that we can bring a thought to reality by wholly and truly believing in it. And, he illustrates various activities to explore the power of your Subconscious mind.
